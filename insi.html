            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>An app that helps UCSD students efficiently find study spaces on and off campus based on their preferences. Developed by me and my team in a UCSD design course.</p>

                <p class="ptext">
                    How might we help UCSD students quickly find locations that meet their personal study space preferences in order to maximize their time to attend to other responsibilities as students?</p>

                <h3 class="ptitle">Mission</h3>
                <p class="ptext">We aim to provide resources about study spaces so that the overall process of finding suitable spots can be done more quickly and be easier for UCSD students.</p>

                <p class="ptext">
                    We wanted our app to have an overall simple and clean feel for most efficient use while still being lively and welcoming for users which can be seen in our moodboards.</p>

                <h3 class="ptitle">Style Guide</h3>
                <p class="ptext">
                    We designed components that could be used throughout the project and standardized interactions and layouts to ensure consistency in our product.　
                    For the color and components of our app, we chose Helvetica, an ADA-compliant typeface, for its sleek look and chose 2 soft colors in addition to white and black, which form an ADA-compliant color palette.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <h3 class="ptitle">Takeaways</h3>
                <p class="ptext">
                    Creating components for the digital prototypes should be saved for once you have reached your hi-fidelity stage. In the early stage, we were quickly throwing out ideas and it was an inefficient use of time to make each idea into a reusable component when we still didn’t know if it would make it into the final stage. Sometimes over-engineering is counterproductive.

                <!-- <p class="ptext">
                    There is no need to do the style guide all at once. When creating the wireframe, all you need to plan out is the layout and nothing else. Agonizing over what colors and fonts look well together on an early iteration and committing to a color palette early, just to change the framework later on and realizing the color palette doesn’t look so appropriate later on is frustrating. Working on the style guide a little at a time on each stage of the prototype is what I have now learned to do.

                    Interviews are also more helpful and important to get right than I first thought. Even if you are only interviewing a small sample of individuals, you can still get valuable data when good questions and tasks are asked of them. That is why while I was conducting the interviews and realizing that some of the questions could have been better worded to get more concise responses and the tasks better ordered so that we could see interviewees knowledge of the app build up. Even a small practice session of interviewing one another to see if the script could use some adjustments would have helped plenty.
