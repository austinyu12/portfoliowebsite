            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                How might we help UCSD students quickly find locations that meet their personal study space preferences in order to maximize their time to attend to other responsibilities as students?

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    We conducted 6 interviews with UCSD students.



From those interviews, we learned:



1. UCSD students need/want somewhere else to study besides Geisel (UCSD’s main library) because they are tired of it and it’s very crowded

2. It is hard to find study spaces on the weekends when the campus is closed

3. Finding other study spaces can be time consuming since it may hard to find exactly what one wants and when one doesn’t know where to check

4. Students want wifi, outlets, whiteboards, an accessible location, good parking, and personal space
